    <h1>Steins;Gate PSP English Patch</h1>
    <img src="logo.jpg">
    <p><i>I am not going to lie, this worldline is decent enough. But this
     patch is going to make it better. El Psy Congroo.</i></p>
    <p>Steins;Gate was released for PSP in 2011. This version of the game did
    not get much attention in the West, since it was available only in Japanese.
    Until now. I present you the Steins;Gate PSP English Patch. Combined from
    bits and pieces of other translations for other platforms, it brings the
    English Steins;Gate experience to the PSP.</p>

    <h2>üî® patching</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Run Windows command prompt.</li>
        <li>Navigate using <span class="code">cd</span> to the folder with the <span class="code">Steins_Gate_PSP_English_Patch_vXXX.exe</span> inside it.</li>
        <li>Run <span class="code">Steins_Gate_PSP_English_Patch_vXXX.exe &lt;original_iso&gt; &lt;patched_iso&gt;</span>.</li>
        <li>The program will immediately throw you back into the command prompt. This is normal, it does all the work in the background. You can monitor its progress via Task Manager. Once it is done patching, the process will automatically terminate, leaving you with the ~1.2GB <span class="code">&lt;patched_iso&gt;</span> file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>‚ùå bugs&typos</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of each. That is exactly why there will be future
    patches with small bugfixes. You can find my contacts at the bottom of the page.
    Or, specifically for this patch, the other way is to make a
    <a href="https://github.com/yar-sh/steins-gate-psp-patch/issues" target="_blank">new issue</a>.</p>
    <p>I kindly ask you to provide the conditions in which unexpected behavior
    occurs. Screenshots and references to story text are very welcome. Save
    data would be even better.</p>
    <p>It is for the best if you report even the smallest things.
    Typos/text overflow/bugs, I try to pay attention to every detail, even though it is
    hard to do so with this massive project.</p>

    <h2>üëÄ extra credits</h2>
    <aside>in the order of their involvement in the project</aside>
    <ul>
        <li>The original toolchain and information: <a href="https://github.com/BASLQC/steins-gate-psp-patch" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/PSP/Steins_Gate_Translation" target="_blank">BASLQC Wiki</a>.</li>
        <li>Riku, the first person to make a proof of concept and to develop a way to inject variable-length strings into the game. Consequently, the author of the above-mentioned toolchain. Their <a href="https://gbatemp.net/members/riku.176570/" target="_blank">GBAtemp</a> profile and a <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/steins-gate-anyone-familiar-with-this-game-engine.346275/page-2#post-5065600" target="_blank">thread with related posts</a>.</li>
        <li>Nysek, motivated me to continue work on my translation once I got the <span class="codeFragment">.BIN</span> files decompiled/decompressed/extracted into Atlas scripts. Their <a href="https://github.com/Nysek/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.</li>
        <li>HoaiTrung97, more motivation for me straight from Japan. Shouted out this translation in one of their own projects. Their <a href="https://gbatemp.net/members/hoaitrung97.461220/" target="_blank">GBAtemp</a> profile.</li>
        <li>ant08, the source of the English translation. Unfortunately, I did not use their latest available version, since the links to all of them are dead. But hey, it still turned out very good. The <a href="http://tsuuun.blogspot.com/2012/01/happy-new-year-everyone-and-yeah-its.html" target="_blank">translation files</a> I used and their <a href="http://tsuuun.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</li>
        <li>CommitteeOfZero, the source of the translated backgrounds, as well as translated/karaoke cutscenes. They have a thing on their <a href="https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero" target="_blank">GitHub</a> called <a href="https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sghd-patch" target="_blank">sghd-patch</a>, which is an improvement over the stock Steam translation of the PC version. Check out their <a href="http://sonome.dareno.me/" target="_blank">website</a> for more S;G-related projects.</li>
        <li>theryusui, was of a huge help to me with the <span class="codeFragment">.KLZ</span> compression/decompression. Practically they dug up their 5 year old version of the only decompressor in the entire world. Their <a href="https://theryusui.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=181" target="_blank">Romhacking</a> profile.</li>
        <li>ilubandroid, provided sick ICON0 and PIC1. They literally look better than the ones in the original game. Their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ilubandroid" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.
