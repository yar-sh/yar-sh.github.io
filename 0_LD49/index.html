   <p class="bold">💡 Idea</p>
   <p>
      Who does not like to be productive at work? Everybody does. Me, you, and especially our managers that are crazy for Agile productivity in a SCRUM environment.
      <br><br>
      You are put in a role of a modern-day software developer, so feel free to spend at least several minutes of your entire working day actually writing code. For this you've got all of the modern, most intuitive, most productive and least infuriating development tools available to you: VSCode and Miserable Troops. The rest of your time you can spend socializing, eating, meditating, and doing way more productive things than coding.
      <br><br>
      Customers don't like you for the product you make, but for the terrible code that is behind it! That's why they keep coming back for every product update where they hope you fixed old bugs, but you - in fact- have only introduced new ones.

     <i>
     NOTE 1: HTML5 version of the game is now canon because it is more graphically broken than the PC version.
     </i>
     <br>
     <i>
     NOTE 2: HTML5 version of the game has broken indentation of code in text messages. Just know that every new level of indentation is +2 space characters.
