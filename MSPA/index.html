    <h1>MSPA Offline Archive</h1>
    <img src="logo.jpg">
    <p>This used to be a full offline copy of <a
	    href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?viewpage=archive"
	    class="linkColor" target="_blank">Microsoft Paint Adventures
	    (MSPA)</a> website. All content in this archive is viewable on any
    device even if you do not have internet connection. 99% of flash animations
    are converted to mp4 videos for browser with no support of *.swf files.
    Basically, you can finally read amazing MSPA comics on your tablet/mobile
    devices, without missing out in an action of animations.</p>
    <p>I should warn you, because of *.swf to *.mp4 convertion, animated
    content takes up a lot more space than before. For your convience animation
    archive was split up into several parts. </p>
    <p><b>This archive was made a long time ago, just after the credits after
    ACT 7 were released. I did not keep up with updating it, because I
    was not happy with it. I planned to remake it several times,
    turning it into a Python scraper so that no legal issues could
    arise with distribution. However, once I had
    time, an even better archive was developed that I had no idea about: <a href="https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/" target="_blank">The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</a>. I strongly recommend you
      to use that version instead. The only thing this
      archive has going for it is the ability to be
      viewed on mobile phones (with some caveats), but
      I would not be surprised if TUHC will add support
      for mobile devices in the future. In every other
      case TUHC is just better: more content, more features, mods, big community, etc (in fact, it is THE recommended way to read Homestuck and other MSPA stories right now, as the official website is a huge mess).</b></p>
    <p><b>The page is presented in its original form (from 2017ish), so it may contain typos and blatantly incorrect information.</b></p>

    <h2>üèÖ features</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><b>ALL COMICS</b>: This archive includes all the current existing comics from MSPA website. Comics content was left as it is on an original website without changes to panels/images/text.</li>
    <li><b>REDESIGN</b>: The color scheme and style of every page was left as in original story, but a great part of distracting banners, news, links and menus was removed. Now it looks simple and nothing distracts you from reading.</li>
    <li><b>ANIMATIONS</b>: All posible animations were converted to mp4, which means you can view them on any device without problems. This will not require you installing addons, as mp4 videos are supported in every browser (who cares about IE6?).</li>

    <h2>‚ùì faq</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What are the ALL COMICS?</b></li>
Every single comic on MSPA: Jailbreak, Problem Sleuth, Bard Quest, Blood Spade (it's only one page, but still), Ryanquest (not mentioned anywhere, but it exists), Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and Homestuck (of course). Archive also contains all the extra pages, that were made for donators, all FAQs, and MSPA donation page.
        <li><b>What are you using to download pages?</b></li>
For this task I wrote a parser. It requires some modifications for every comic, but it's basically the same concept throughout. To convert Homestuck animations to mp4 I used <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel" target="_blank">Swivel</a>. And conversion makes files larger, of course, so animations are split into four parts. More about it later.
        <li><b>You wrote something about 99% of animations. What are the 1%?</b></li>
Those are not animations, but interactive games, which involve user's input. I'm not going to convert them to HTML5 canvas games, so to check them out you still will need to have Internet connection.
        <li><b>How are archives divided?</b></li>
I have a single MSPA-Offline archive, which contains all the pages with all the graphics for all the comics. Animations are divided into several parts, because they take up more space. Quick overview:<br>Part-1: ACT 1 - ACT5ACT1 <br>Part-2: ACT5ACT2 - INTERMISSION2<br>Part-3: ACT6 - ACT6INTERMISSON5<br>Part-4: ACT6ACT6 - ACT7
        <li><b>Why Mediafire?</b></li>
Mediafire was my choice as it does not have bandwidth limit, so you can download archives without limiting the amount of how much you can download.
        <li><b>Any torrents?</b></li>
Oh yes! Single torrent file is in the download section, although I think that it would be faster to download archives from the Mediafire, because not that many people seed it. 
        <li><b>Why are screenshots so bad?</b></li>
First, it's really hard to make a screenshot of a whole screen and then paste into 750px image box. Second, I can't find any good examples of pages to make good screenshots. Two will do.
        <li><b>I found a mistoke on a page. What can I do?</b></li>
	<s>That's great, because I'm sure there are plenty of mistakes. You can find how to contact me on the contact page.</s><br>
	Use TUHC. This will never be updated again.
