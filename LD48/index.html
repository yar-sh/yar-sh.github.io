   <p>
      After the Singularity‚Äôs expansion in <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/abstractio" target="_blank">Abstractio</a> and the assumed end of space and reality that were just being built, perhaps the end was just a beginning? A beginning of something greater, that would reach incredible depths?
   </p><p>
      The expansion resulted in an implosion, which produced unstable blobs of matter that will shape the new reality. The blobs seemingly have a possibility to continuously split themselves and the space around them, resulting in the 2^n expansion. To become stable, the blobs must all converge at a single point in space. And this convergence should happen not just at one level of expansion but on all of them - at the infinity depths.
   </p><p>
      Your goal is to guide the blobs to the points of convergence by moving them and the space around them. I wish I took Physics in University besides 4 classes of Real Analysis to throw in some quantum mechanics into this‚Ä¶

    <h2>‚è¨ downloads</h2>
    <aside>HTML5 version of the game might have issues with audio levels and performance, as GameMaker:Studio‚Äôs HTML5 export is pretty trash. Specifically, upon loading the HTML5 version of the game be sure to click somewhere on the page before the game loads as otherwise the audio will not play.</aside>
